<h3>Dealing with errors</h3>

<p>When the editor code has an error that stops compilation, it will appear at the top of the page next to the status button. Note that the status color reflect the state of the editor. For example, try loading the following code which will raise a compilation error:<p>

<div class="code">; Too many close paren
(def clojure "awesome")) </div>

<div class="code">; Too many close paren
(def clojure "awesome")) </div>

<div class="code">; Too many close paren
(def clojure "awesome")) </div>

<div class="code">; Too many close parenthesis
(def clojure "awesome")) </div>

<p>Once you've fixed the code, you can either simply move focus to the REPL, at which point the code will be reloaded automatically, or press the status button (which should say <em>modified</em>) to reload the code manually.</p>

<p>Errors on the REPL will come up in the usual way. Try to run <code>(im-not-defd 123)</code> to see what this would look like.</p>
