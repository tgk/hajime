# Hajime: Clojure Cloud IDE

This is a fork of the Hajime IDE. I customised it to be used for a hands-on session in logic programming for FP Days 2013. The main difference is, that no tutorial is presented, and that the content of the presenters buffer in the top right corner is persisted and shared with anyone hooked up to the system.

Here follows the original README:

Based on [TryClojure](http://tryclj.com), built for the [Cambridge Software Craftsmanship](http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Software-Craftsmanship/) Clojure workshop.

You can have a look at it in action [on heroku](http://hajime.herokuapp.com)

## Usage

Use [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) or `lein run`

## Ideas

  * Use [Clojure Koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans) as base?
  * Construct an app collaboratively? (zmq?)
  * Straight tutorial?
  * Mail results?
  * Visual programming?
  * Game of life kata?
  * Server hook for web dev?
